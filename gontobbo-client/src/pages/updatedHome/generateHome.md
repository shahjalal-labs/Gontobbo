You are a senior full-stack developer.

Rewrite the following files to follow real-world best practices, modular architecture, scalability, and clarity.
Your goals are:

âœ… Improve modularity  
âœ… Enhance readability  
âœ… Follow real-world React + Node best practices  
âœ… Modernize structure if needed  
âœ… DO NOT REMOVE functionality

Also, generate a `.sh` script that:

- from .sh script i will just run the .sh file and everything will be done
- i don't wanna copy paste text manually
- my aproach is just run .sh file and everything will be auto written
